# cem4all
This repository contains the implementation for the convex envelope method (CEM) for arbitrary chemical systems (in terms of aggregate state, number of components, and number of phases) [1]. The present version of the CEM is heavily based on our previous publication [2] that describes the CEM for arbitrary liquid phase equilibria. The repository also includes code from the implementation of the HANNA-model [3].

TODO: graphics and concept of the CEM


# How to cite

To cite the CEM or when you are using code from this repository, please cite our works on that topic [1, 2]. When you are using the HANNA-model, please cite [3].

# Installation

TODO: how to reproduce, set up. Python 3.11.7
